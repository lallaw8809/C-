# Class and Object

A class is a data structucture that contains a memberes (contans and field) and methods.

`class.cs`  Sample example code of class  and object

Here it is the detailed description of various data members and function methos used in the c# c.

# Class modifier
Thease are the class modifiers in c#.

- public   
- protected  
- private  
- internal  
- abstarct   
- static   
- sealed   
- new  
- class_modifier_unsafe  

# Constructors
`constructors.` Sample code of constructor class  

# Static class

- A static class cannot be instantiated.
- Can not use a new operator to create a variable type of the class type (No instance variable).
- Contains only static members.
- Cannot contain Instance Constructors.
- It is sealed so we can not inheritance the static class

`staticClass.`  Sample example static code of class  

# Abstract class

- Abstract class is marked as a keyword `abstract` in the class definition and `abstarct` means that the class is incomplete and can not initialized. 
- Can not created a instace of this class but can be used in drived class.
- An abstract class cannot be sealed.

`abstract.cs` Showed a sample code that how to use the abstract class, virtual and override.  

# Inheritance

`inheritance.cs` Sample code of inheritance   
`multiInheritance.cs` Sample code of multi inheritance
