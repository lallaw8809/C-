### Nullable

It is special type of  datatypes in c# and we can store a range of the value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 or null.  
```sh
Syntex
< data_type> ? <variable_name> = null;
```

The Null Coalescing Operator (??)  
If the value is not assigned to variable then its assing the value (5) into the number.  
```sh
number = variable ?? 5;
```
